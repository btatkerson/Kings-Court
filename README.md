# King's Court

The original card game by Benjamin Atkerson.

### Running the game

```
Windows users - You'll need to download Python 3 and install pyqt4 and colorama through pip
                From there, run main_game.py

Ubuntu 12.04/Debian 7 - run INSTALL as superuser or download python3, python3-pyqt4, and python3-colorama through apt
                        chmod a+rwx 'run_game.sh' in the directory you extract the game files to
                        cd into directory and type './run_game.sh'
```

I promise to update this soon.
