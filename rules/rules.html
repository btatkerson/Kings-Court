<h1>King's Court</h1>

<p><h3>Objective</h3>
The goal in King's Court is to be the player with the most points at the end of the game.
</p>

<p>
<h3>How to Play</h3>
Players take alternating turns placing one card at a time on an empty gameboard space. The game ends when all empty spaces on
the board have been filled or if no additional plays are possible.
<br><br>
At the start of each game, all player's begin the game with 0 points. When a player's turn starts, that player has to select a card/tile from their hand and place it on an empty space on the board.
Upon the card/tile being placed, the player will then calculate the score of the move they made (see: <b>Scoring</b>). Once the player has
finished calculating their score and adding it to their total points, the player will drawl another card from the stack (unless empty) before the next player in the sequence makes their play, calculates their score, and
so on and so forth.
<br>
<h3>Making a Move</h3>
Each time a player's turn comes up, the player has to place a card in an empty spot on the board.
Beyond scoring, there are other rules that must be considered when a player reaches their turn.

<br><br>Not all open spaces are legally playable. A move is only legal if:
<ol><b><li>
The empty spot has no neighboring cards (left, right, above, below) with the same <i>VALUE</i> as card/tile being placed *</b>
<br><br>ie. a blue six in your hand cannot go in an empty spot with any colored six to the immediate left, right, up, or down of that spot
</li>
<br>
<b><li>
It touches another card either on the corners or the immediate left, right, up, or down. **</b>
<br><br>
ie. a card cannot go in a spot with eight blank spaces around it.
<br><br>
<b></li></b>
<br>
<li>
<b>Blue spaces on board can only be filled in once the surrounding green spaces have been filled in by cards</b>

</ol>
<b>*</b> The exception to this is <b>mercy rule</b> which allows this only if the player is down to one card and no spots are legally playable
<br><br>
<b>**</b> The King/0 in the middle of the board is the exception to this rule. A king alone cannot have a card built off of it.
<h3>Scoring</h3>
There are many different ways to earn points in King's Court that are all dependent on the empty spot where the player lays a card
during their turn. Ideally, a player's objective is to try and make high scoring plays while also not giving his/her opponents a
higher scoring opportunity. There are many variables to consider and there often isn't a "perfect move"; a single card can affect
over a dozen spaces in a single move.
<br>
<h4>The King's Purpose</h4>
The King is the card in the middle of the board represented with either "K" or "0". The King's suit/color determines the <b>Prime Suit</b>.
The Prime Suit's role is applied in Column and Row Scoring. The King has a card value of 10 which is applied in the Rule of Sevens and Chain Scoring.

<h4>Rule of Sevens</h4>
The single most important scoring rule is the <b>Rule of Sevens</b>. The Rule of Sevens is described as so:
<br><br>
<b><ol>
<li> If a player's <i>Sum Total</i> for a move lands on a <i>Checkpoint</i>, the player adds the checkpoint's value to their score.</li>
   <br>
	<li> If a player's Sum Total falls below the checkpoint, no points are earned via the Rule of Sevens, but additional scoring combinations still apply.</li>
	<br>
	<li> A player's Sum Total for a move shall not exceed the current checkpoint on a space without 10 point penalty.</li>	
	</ol>	
<br></b>
The Rule of Sevens is based on the four side spaces (left, right, up, down)
surrounding the empty spot a player is placing their card. Players must find the sum of the card values surrounding the empty space to the immediate 
left, right, up, and down of said space. This is called the <b>Space Value</b>. When a player makes a move, the player will add the value of their card to 
the Space Value to create the <b>Sum Total</b>.

  						<br><br>The Checkpoint for the same empty space is 7 (first multiple of 7 beyond 3). Ideally,
  						        a 4 would be best placed here in order to gain Sum Total: 3+4=7 points.</center></figcaption>

  <figcaption><center>The Space Value for the empty space in the middle of the cross is 3+3+5+6=17.
  				  <br><br>The Checkpoint for the same empty space is 21 (first multiple of 7 beyond 17). Ideally, a 4 would be best
  				  			 placed here in order to gain Sum Total: 17+4=21 points.</center></figcaption>

</center>
<br>
The Sum Total is important. Ideally, a player wants a Sum Total of a multiple of seven. The four possible multiples of seven (7, 14, 21, 28) are
called the <b>Checkpoints</b>. If a player's Sum Total hits any of the Checkpoints, the player gains the Checkpoint's value in points in addition to other possible scoring combos.
<br>
<br>
There is a catch, though. A player's Sum Total <b>should not exceed</b> the next Checkpoint above the Space Value or the player is <b>penalized
10 points</b>. 
<br><br>
To explain, an empty space has three cards (left, right, up) of values 2, 2, and 6, an empty space immediately below it (with value 0), 
which gives a Space Value of 2+2+6 = 10. Ideally, a player would place a 4 down in this empty spot to make a Sum Total of 10+4 = 14 and that means 14 
points for the player. 14 is also the next multiple of 7 (the checkpoint) after the Space Value of 10.
<br><br>
If the player places a 1 or 3 and makes a Sum Total of 10+1=11 or 10+3=13, points won't be gained, nor lost under the Rule of Sevens,
additional scoring combinations still apply. 
<br><br>
If a player placed a 5 in the empty spot, the Sum Total would be 10+5=15 <b>which exceeds</b> the "checkpoint" 14. This is called 
<b>Breaking Seven</b> and immediately subtracts 10 points from the player's score, but players must still count additional scoring combinations and
add them to their score.
<br>
<br>
If a Space Value is already equal to 0, 7, 14, 21, or 28, a player will treat the following multiple of 7 as the checkpoint.
<br>
ie. an empty space with two cards (6 and 1) in two of the four side spaces around it has a Space Value of 7. The checkpoint for this empty space
is now 14, which cannot be made, nor exceeded with cards valued 1 through 6. In this case, we call the space <b>steady</b>. All possible cards placed
in the spot in its current state will make 0 points under the Rule of Sevens.
<h4>Column and Row Scoring</h4>
There are two ways to score points based on the column and row a player places his card.
<ol><li>
<b>A player gains their card's value in points for every card of equal value in the same row/column they placed it.</b>
<br><br>
ie. The top-left corner of the board is empty, there is a blue 5 and a red 5 in the top row, and a green 5 in the left-most
column. If a player places the other green 5 in the top left corner of the board, the player would gain 5 (card value) x 3 = 15 points 
in addition to other potential scoring combinations.
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>A player gains a single point for each card in the same row/column that matches the Prime Suit.</b>
<br><br>
ie. the board has a blue King. The Prime Suit is blue. The player places a card in the top left corner of the board. The top row on the board
has a blue 4 and a blue 3, the left-most column contains a blue 3, a blue 1, and a blue 6. There are five Prime Suit colored cards in the same
column and row as the top-left corner space, the player earns 5 points in addition to other potential scoring combinations.

</li></ol>
<h4>Diagonal/Chain Scoring</h4>
The last type of scoring is based on the cards/tiles touching the corners of the empty space the player chooses to play their card.
There are no rules restricting which cards can touch the corner of the card that's in play, cards of the same value can touch on corners unlike
cards in the Side Spaces (left, right, up, down) touching the space being played. The corners are where Chain Scoring comes into play. The 
important rule to remember is that a Chain starts on any corner of the empty space a player makes their move, and all cards in a chain must be
in a straight line connected at the immediate corners. There are two ways to earn points through chaining:
<ol>
<li>
<b>If a series of cards are chained by their VALUE at the corner of an empty spot and the player lays a card of EQUAL VALUE,
the player earns the card's value of points per every card in the chain.</b>
<br><br>
ie. the top-left corner of the board is empty, the space on the bottom-right corner of the empty top-left space has a blue 4 in it. The space
to the bottom-right of the blue 4 has a red 4 in it. If the player places a red 4 in the empty top-left corner of the board, the player would
earn 4 (card value) x 2 (blue 4 and red 4 in straight, sequential bottom-right diagonal) = 8 points.
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>If a series of cards are chained by their COLOR at the corner of an empty spot and the player lays a card of EQUAL SUIT/COLOR,
the player earns points equal to the VALUES SHOWN ON EACH CARD OF THE COLOR CHAIN.</b>
<br><br>
ie. the top-left corner of the board is empty, the space on the bottom-right corner of the empty top-left space has a blue 4 in it. The space
to the bottom-right of the blue 4 has a blue 6 in it. If the player places a blue 2 in the empty top-left corner of the board, the player would
earn 4 (blue 4) + 6 (blue 6) = 10 points because those were the values of the blue cards in the straight, sequential bottom-right diagonal of the
blue 2 the player placed on the board.
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>If a card of EQUAL VALUE AND COLOR to the card being played is chained onto the corner, points are stacked for VALUE and COLOR chaining</b>
<br><br>
ie. modifying the example above - the top-left corner of the board is empty, the space on the bottom-right corner of the empty top-left space has a blue 4 in it. The space
to the bottom-right of the blue 4 has a blue 6 in it. If the player places a blue 4 in the empty top-left corner of the board, the player would
earn 4 (blue 4) + 6 (blue 6) = 10 points for color chaining and 4 (blue 4 at bottom-right of top-left corner) points for value chaining for
14 points total.</li>
